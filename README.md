## Binary search trees
C linux program which supports the following opperations:
* Search
* Insertion
* Removal of whole keys
* Hierarchical representation of said tree using teh gfx library (made by my teacher)
* Un-allocation

##### "The code must compile under gcc's C99 with no warnings or errors with the -Wall -Wextra -pedantic flags."
##### It was also required for all the things to be inside the main.c file.

##### The insertion, removal, search algorithms were implemented in accor to the teacher's specifications.
